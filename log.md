**Today's Progress**: Did the mongoose connectivity with Node.js

**Thoughts:** This was really cool at the command line interface, but the actual deployment and usage is yet to be done!

### Day 1: June 8, 2020 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Gave an awesome front end overall today after working for many days on my ConFuSion webiste!

**Thoughts**: I really need to brush up more and more or else these things will surely get wiped offf from mind!
  This is something that I'd state herein in the thought section of this day as well, because there are many JS components that need to be brushed on a daily basis to maintain the connectivity.
